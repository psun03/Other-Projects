# XMPP Project

Just a project I was working a long time ago. The idea of the project to control a outlet with the X10 Home Automation system. A CM17A FireCracker Computer Interface Module 
was hooked up to a Raspberry Pi via a usb/serial converter. I wrote a service written python to listen for commands via XMPP. I also wrote
an android app that sends and listens for responses from the raspberry pi.
